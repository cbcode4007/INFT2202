document.write('<p class="fs-5">The Dragon Ball Z anime follows Goku, who is an alien originally sent to Earth as an infant to conquer it, but has instead befriended the planet\'s inhabitants and become an emblem of self-improvement for many. He is exceptionally strong and yet gentle, constantly seeking challenges and yet harboring no resentment in his heart for anyone. We here at Colin Labs find him pretty cool.</p>');

document.write('<p class="fs-5">Paramore is a group of artists who we here at Colin Labs seriously dig. One of their best songs and a personal recommendation of ours is Tell Me It\'s Okay. It has a very unique and captivating sound to it, and if you\'re sad, you may get even more of a kick out of it with its lyrics.</p>');

document.write('<p class="fs-5">1984 is a book written by George Orwell that follows Winston Smith in his journey to attain freedom from a society so constricted that there is a Thought Police. It is a classic with a heartbreaking twist that we shan\'t spoil here, as it would probably be better to experience yourself. We here at Colin Labs rate it a 9 and are into George Orwell\'s works primarily because of this novel.</p>');
